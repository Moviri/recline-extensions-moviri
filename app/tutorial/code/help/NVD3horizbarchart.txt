<h4>NVD3 Horizontal barchart</h4>
<p>
This example shows an horizontal barchart made with NVD3 framework.<br>
It's much the same as the previous example, only rotated by 90 degress.
Tolltips, Legend and Controls considerations are the same. Note that you can enable/disable any one of them in the initialization options.
You can as well start with an already "stacked" chart by adding "stacked: true" to the options, if you wish.
