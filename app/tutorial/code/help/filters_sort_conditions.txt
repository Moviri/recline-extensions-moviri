<h4>Filters and sort conditions</h4>
<p>
This tutorial shows a table that can be filtered by country or by gender by choosing the value from the provided list-boxes.<br>
The table can also be ordered by choosing one of the fields in the third listbox named "sort by".<br>
<br>
The bindings on the controls have been done straight with jQuery for simplicity.<br>
This is not the preferred method, however: in later tutorial examples you will be told about actions, which are more versatile and powerful.<br>
However, nothing stops you from using the easy way (simple jQuery bindings) to achieve your goal.<br>
<br>
Also note that the SlickGrid table can be ordered also by clicking on the column name. But this has been done like this to prove that you can
easily order data before feeding it to any control.
