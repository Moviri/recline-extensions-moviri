<h4>Generic Filter - Dropdown Date Range</h4>
<p>
This example shows how to use a control filter to apply actions to a model.
The control type for this example is "dropdown_date_range" which lists the most common date ranges like "past week" or "this month" in a dropdown list. Selecting an item activates the corresponding date range.<br>
There are also three custom date ranges at the end: they have been embedded in the initialization code (see section "userFields" to show how to add extra date ranges).
