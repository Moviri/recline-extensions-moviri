<h4>Generic Filter - Multibutton</h4>
<p>
This example shows how to use a multiple selection control filter (named "multibutton") to apply actions to a model.<br>
This roughly the same example for "radiobuttons", only using its multi-selection counterpart.<br>
Here you may select and deselect options by pressing the desired buttons<br>
The color for the buttons may be changed via the option "selectedClassName" (and we did), but by default the "radiobuttons" control uses "btn-primary" (selected buttons are blue) while "multibutton" control uses "btn-info" (selected buttons are cyan).
