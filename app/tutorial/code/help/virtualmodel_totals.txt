<h4>Virtual model: totals and subtotals</h4>
<p>
This example uses a model (visible in the top table) and uses a virtual model to compute totals and subtotals for the given measures.<br>
The virtual model has:<br>
<ul>
<li>Two aggregation dimensions ("country" and "gender", that is used by the "groupBy")</li>
<li>One aggregation functions for virtualmodel rows ("sum", that will be applied to the measures)</li>
<li>One aggregation measures ("visits", that will be computed with the functions above once grouped)</li>
<li>One measure for totals ("visits_sum": the one created by the above aggregation)</li>
<li>One aggregation function for totals ("sum": that will process the subtotals and compute the grand totals)</li>
</ul>
The resulting virtual model contents are visible in the bottom table (a "View.SlickGrid"), which has been supplied some specific option in order to display the extra data (totals and subtotals).<br>
These options are "showPartitionedData" (to show subtotals at the end of each section) and "showTotals" (to show row with grand totals at the bottom).<br>
Also some CSS styling has been used to center-align the cell contents to ensure readability. The options used is "fieldFormatters".<br>
