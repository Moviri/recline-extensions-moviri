<h4>Generic Filter - Dropdown</h4>
<p>
This example shows how to use a single selection ("term" type) control filter to apply actions to a model.
The data model simulates a network admin case in which the sysadmin wants to monitor the network bandwidth used by employees.<br>
The control at the top left allows the selection of an employee. The indicators at the top show the total value figures for download, upload and accesses.<br>
The chart shows the downloads (the most important KPI) for the selected employee(s) in a month's period.<br>The table at the bottom shows the model data for the selected employee(s).<br>
Whenever the user selects a different value in the control, all other views update accordingly.
