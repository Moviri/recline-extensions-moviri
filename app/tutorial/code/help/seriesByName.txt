<h4>Using series by name</h4>
<p>In this example you can see how series for charts (xCharts or NVD3 charts) can be created from the data model.</p>
<p>This example focuses on series by name, which is applicable only when all series names are known in advance and strictly match some columns models.</p>
<p>In this case, in fact, series names are hard-coded in chart initialization parameters.</p>
