<h4>Generic Filter - Slider Styled</h4>
<p>
This example shows how to use a single selection ("term" type) control filter to apply selection actions to a model.<br>
The scenario is identical to "slider" example and shares 99% of the code. The only difference is in the control used, which has an extra "_styled"<br>
It's a cooler version of the original "slider", without the "set" button, and which issues actions whenever the slider changes.<br>
Try it out for yourself: you will see the slickgrid rows highlight on slider changes.
