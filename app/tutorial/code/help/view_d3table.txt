<h4>View.D3table</h4>
<p>
This example creates a D3 table. It's a custom table, drawn graphically on the SVG, with following features:<br>
<ul>
<li>the row height can be set as desired, within reasonable bounds (not too small or text inside will not be readable)</li>
<li>it can render a twin barchart inside any column: such a column will display two percentage values into one single cell.</li>
</ul>
