<h4>Model with CSV backend</h4>
<p>When using a CSV file as data source, it's important to specify the
exact field type in advance, since CSV doesn't store this piece of
information with the data (like JSON, instead, does).</p>
<p>This must be accomplished by using "fieldsType" option. Any field that's not listed
inside this option will be treated as a string by default.</p>
<p>Failing in doing so may cause your page to exhibit incorrect behaviour.</p>
<p>Also note that date fields must match your current locale or they will not correctly parsed. For instance, if you have english locale in your browser, dates should be in format "mm/dd/yyyy". Conversely, if your locale is italian, format should be "dd/mm/yyyy"</p>
