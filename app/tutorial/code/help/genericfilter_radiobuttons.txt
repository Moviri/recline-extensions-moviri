<h4>Generic Filter - Radiobuttons</h4>
<p>
This example shows how to use a single selection control filter (named "radiobuttons") to apply actions to a model.<br>
This almost the same example for "dropdown", only using a buttonset that has a radio button behaviour: pressing a button deselect the previously selected button<br>
