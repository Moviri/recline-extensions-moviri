<h4>Generic Filter - Month Week Calendar</h4>
<p>
This example shows how to use a control filter to apply actions to a model.
The control type for this example is "month_week_calendar" which lists all months or all weeks of the selected year.<br>
"Year" dropdown list allows the user to select a different year (from 2010 onwards).<br>
"Type" dropdown list allows the user to switch between months and weeks.<br>
