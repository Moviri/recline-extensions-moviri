<h4>View.D3ChoroplethMap</h4>
<p>
This tutorial example shows Italy map, where region boundaries are colored using a color schema calculated on region density values.<br>
Also a couple of actions have been instantiated:<br>
<ol>
<li>An action that selects the slickgrid rows when you select a region on the map</li>
<li>An action that selects regions on the map when you select rows from the slick grid (multiple selections allowed)</li>
</ol>
Also when you hover on the map, a custom tooltip shows the Density value.<br>
The initialization is rather straightforward: you have to supply a valid map JSON, the center of the map, scale and dimensions, plus some extra option.<br>
The only thing to remark here is in the action mapped to map-clicking:  the "destLayer" must be supplied (in this case: "itaRegions") since a map may have multiple layers and only one of them contains the region names.
