<h4>Model with JSONP backend</h4>
<p>
One of the preferred methods for loading dynamic data into a model is the use of a JSONP backend.
<br><br>
Typically a web service queries, when prompted, its database according to the provided parameters, and returns the requested data in JSONP format.
<br><br>
This data is actually structured into a JSON object and embedded in a callback so that the data can be remotely imported by the caller via code execution.
<br><br>
The dataset just needs to know the URL (of the web service, or, even simpler, even of a local JSONP file on the server) to query and the web service ID name.
<br><br>
All other parameters ("fieldsFormat" and "renderer") are used to force a standard and readable format for the date.
