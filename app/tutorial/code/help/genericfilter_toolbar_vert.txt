<h4>Generic Filter - Toolbar Vertical</h4>
<p>
This example shows how to create multiple filters in a single actions and embed them in a verical toolbar.<br>
The example scenario is the same download/upload example as seen in other generic filter examples. Only that we added a further filter on weeks (field "Data") by using a dropdown_date_range with custom dates<br>
As you can see both filters have been created inside a single multiFilterCtlr object and attached to a single action that can trigger both filters to the same model.<br>
Finally, we didn't declared the layout (vertical is the default) and didn't hide the background to have a vertical toolbar-like look & feel.<br>
Notice that this time we also used a title and a description on the toolbar.
