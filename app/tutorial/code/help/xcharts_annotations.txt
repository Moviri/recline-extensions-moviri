<h4>xCharts annotations</h4>
<p>
This example shows an xCharts timeline which uses extra annotations on the chart.<br>
These annotations can be possibly used to identify/understand the trends of the chart. It's completely up to the publisher to supply annotations that make sense and "affect" the chart accordingly.<br>  
Annotations are passed via a (possibly) dedicated dataset (2 fields needed: a date and a textual description).<br>
To read the annotations on the chart just hover on the letter "A" thru "H" with your mouse.<br>
Note that annotation don't necessarily refer to a specific serie only because the square is placed on a series' line or another. Their placement is by default on the highest series' line for that specific timestamp.
