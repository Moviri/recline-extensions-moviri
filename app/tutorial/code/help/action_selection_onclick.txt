<h4>Selection Actions - onHover</h4>
<p>
This example uses two models, each with different data but a common field.<br>
Then there's a dropdown list that is populated with the common field, and two slickgrids each populated with a different model.<br>
Whenever the user selects an item from the dropdown list, the slickgrids react accordingly, selecting the matching rows.
