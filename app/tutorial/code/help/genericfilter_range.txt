<h4>Generic Filter - Range</h4>
<p>
This example shows how to use a control filter to apply actions to a model.
The control type for this example is "range". When you type in new start and stop ID values and press the "set" button, the action is triggered and the data on the table are selected.<br>
Also, the two indicators shows the average age and the total number of visits for the selected ID ranges.<br>
Just make sure you type in valid ranges. This control is pretty basic and performs no checks whatsoever.
