<h4>Using series by value</h4>
<p>In this example you can see how series for charts (xCharts or NVD3 charts) can be created from the data model.</p>
<p>This example focuses on series by value, which is applicable also when series names aren't known in advance, so they can't be hard-coded in chart initialization parameters.</p>
<p>In this case you must provide the field name holding series names and the field name holding current serie values.</p>
<p>Note that the resulting chart is the same as in the previous example.</p>
