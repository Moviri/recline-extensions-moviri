<h4>Generic Filter - Range Slider Styled</h4>
<p>
This example shows how to use a control filter to apply actions to a model.
The control type for this example is a "range_slider_styled", which has two separate sliders and no "set" button: the action is triggered on every change.<br>
The rest is identical to the previous example.<br>
