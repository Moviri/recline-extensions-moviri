<h4>View.D3CooccurrenceMatrix</h4>
<p>
D3CooccurrenceMatrix is a matrix view which displays the co-occurrence between data rows. Think of it as a correlation between data.<br>
The tutorial shows a list of persons and the total times they met each other during a reference period.<br>
This matrix type in this example is simmetrical by construction. This isn't mandatory but is strongly suggested in order to better identify clusters<br>
The control has three distinct option for ordering data (achieved by passing "orderMode" at init time, or setting it then forcing a redraw):<br>
<ul>
<li>by cluster: the computation logic attempts to group the data by common chunks called clusters</li>
<li>by value: biggest values should appear first</li>
<li>by name: simple alphabetical ordering</li>
</ul>
