<h4>View.SlickGridGraph inner chart</h4>
<p>
This example shows how to create a SlickGrid from a model and populate some fields with custom HTML content.<br>
By using option "customHtmlFormatters" we redefine the rendering function for the fields with the listed IDs.<br>
The function passed to every customHtmlFormatter is defined as follows:<br>
<pre>
formula: function (record) {
...
	return htmlContent
}
</pre>
Variable "record" contains all value attributes of the current row, so the final HTML content can be use combination of values on the same row.  
For example the field "Delta Perc" is actually showing the value of the field "Media" (hidden in this example, because it's shown in field "Delta Perc") and a little barchart built from a couple of colored DIVs, whose size depend on "Delta Perc" percentual value. 
Field "Sesso", instead, adds an icon to the field depending on field value.
