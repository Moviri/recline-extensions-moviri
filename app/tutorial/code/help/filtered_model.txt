<h4>Filtered model</h4>
<p>
In this example there are two models:
<ul>
<li>a main Dataset</li> 
<li>a FilteredDataset that inherits completely the contents from the previous one</li>
</ul>
The light-grey section shows the main dataset and allows filtering by age range only.<br>
The light-yellow section shows the filtered dataset and allows filtering by country and gender (but not by age).<br>
<br>
It's easy to notice that, whenever a filter is applied to the main dataset, also the inheriting FilteredDataset is affected.<br>
However, filtering the FilteredDataset in the light-yellow section doesn' affect the main Dataset in the top section.<br>
<br>
This example also shows the usage of the "termAdvanced" filter in order to choose a range of lines from the model:<br>
for instance the age range 20-39 results in two separate "termAdvanced" filters:<br>
<ul>
<li>greater than or equal to 20</li>
<li>less than 40</li>
</ul>
that are applied together.
